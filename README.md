  and results in meaningful observations to extract knowledge from crime records to
  understand criminal behavior better and ultimately prevent future crimes.

Result:

  Address, Accused Age, etc) and analyzes them to find patterns of crime happening, and
  processes the data to analyze factors that lead to criminal activity. (solutions working
