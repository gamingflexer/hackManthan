Explanation:
- Criminology is an area where the scientific study of crime and criminal behavior focuses.
  As part of criminology, crime analysis is tasked with exploring and discovering crime and
  its relationship with criminals.

Expectation:
- Provide an Interface/Application that accepts police investigation data that examines
  and results in meaningful observations to extract knowledge from crime records to
  understand criminal behavior better and ultimately prevent future crimes.

Result:
- An application that stores previous records (such as district, police station, ACT-Section,
  Address, Accused Age, etc) and analyzes them to find patterns of crime happening, and
  processes the data to analyze factors that lead to criminal activity. (solutions working
  with the Hindi Language will be given preference)
